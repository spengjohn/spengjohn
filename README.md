Hi, I’m Spencer. Contact: @spengjohn on LinkedIn.

I'm a junior CS student currently learning Algos, OS, and Networking.
Prev taken courses include Intro to Programming, Computer Architecture, and Data Structures.

I am relatively new to programming and have enjoyed expanding my knowledge and skillsets during my undergrad career thus far.

The majority of the repos hosted on this account will be school projects/personal projects.
